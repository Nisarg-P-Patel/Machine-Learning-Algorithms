# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms using Python. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and experimentation.

## Algorithms Included

- **Linear Regression from Scratch**: Implementation of linear regression without using any libraries.
- **Multiple Regression from Scratch**: Extension of linear regression to handle multiple features.
- **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**: A simple and effective classification algorithm.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data.
- **Decision Tree**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification technique.
- **Multi-layer Perceptron**: A basic implementation of a neural network.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
